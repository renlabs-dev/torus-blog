## Quick TLDR on Torus and the v0

Torus is an open-ended experiment to bootstrap a self-assembling, self-organizing & evolving superorganism, that is capable of integrating the present and coming waves of AI & agent breakthroughs on the fly and assemble specialized autonomous swarms, all fractally aligned towards Stake and the unified whole.

We are building a novel protocol architecture with a minimal "Calculus of Organization" at its heart. This is a significant research & development undertaking that takes time, however, we are confident that the theoretical model is sound and it is now mainly about engineering.

The Torus v0 is a very trimmed implementation, lacking core concepts but is capable of coordinating and incentivizing development and integration of agents, modules, libraries and tools while staying fully agnostic to their substrate, design and function. This means the Torus v0 is compatible with all existing agent frameworks and tooling.

The v0 allows the formation of a developer ecosystem while the v1 Torus architecture is under development. Read this to learn more about the concepts of the Torus v0.

Next on the release roadmap are features to allow the first assembly of collaborative swarms, with an open and evolving backend and internal market forces.

## How does Staking work?

Holders can Stake $TORUS to the allocator through the wallet app.

This will pay out dividends every 100 blocks (~14 mins), which are auto-compounding, meaning they are automatically also staked. The allocator charges 0% fee and the app is permissionless.

Dividend rate (APR) is the same for all allocator stakers, but varies depending on:

- how much supply has been staked
- the rate of total emissions in the network
- the current split between incentives and dividends

All 3 of those factors are changing dynamically, hence expect volatility in the APR % every now and then, but especially in the first week.

The initial parameters are:

- recycling: 81%
- treasury: 5%
- network: 14%
- incentives/dividend split: 30/70%

Days from now they may be different.

These parameters are expected to change dynamically based on DAO proposals, which can execute within 2 days.

Under the initial parameters, 81% of emissions are recycled (not used, available in the future), and 19% go towards the network, and from that amount, 70% goes towards stakers as dividends, and 30% go towards the agents/modules.

As the network becomes more populated, the DAO is likely going to increase the incentives for agents/modules.

## How does the Allocator work?

You can actively allocate incentives among agents and modules with your stake using the allocator platform.

This allows you to increase the focus of the network towards the things you deem valuable for Torus growth. However, this does not influence your dividends.

The allocator is a permissionless web platform maintained by renlabs. Users stake $TORUS to the allocator key, allowing them to set incentive weights with their stake through the platform.

The curator DAO is actively monitoring the incentive landscape and has the option, based on common sense, to apply an incentive penalty factor to agents/modules. This is to reduce over-incentivization, preventing the waste of emissions.
