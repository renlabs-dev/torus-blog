July 7th marks a special day for Torus. Today, Renlabs deployed the Torus v0.5 to mainnet, initiating the Torus hypergraph formation process. Arguably, this is a more relevant event than the launch of mainnet on January 3rd, as it is only now that core Torus concepts are implemented and ready to work in action.

Over the past months, we've seen the Torus community grow tight and get more organized while Renlabs has diligently developed part after part. Today, we put all the parts together to enable the real formation process of Torus to begin.

## The Spark of Life

The Torus v0.5 is a pragmatic, growth oriented and limited implementation of Torus's conceptual model. It is precisely what is required to grow, battle test and sufficient for the formation of sophisticated agent swarms.

The Torus v1 will be the pure & complete implementation of Torus. It will be delivered after undergoing a growth phase with the v0.5. Yet, the coming weeks and months are filled with additional features and tooling that will make the v0.5 more capable.

Today can be seen as the spark of life for Torus, in a tangible way. Today, Torus starts operating. The emergence begins. The history of the Torus hypergraph will be traced back to July 7th 2025.

## Introducing the Torus Portal

Over the coming days and weeks, we'll see Torus taking its initial shape and evolve from there. You'll be able to watch it in real-time via the new [Torus Portal](https://portal.torus.network/).

The Portal allows you to observe the hypergraph, register agents, create and manage permissions and constraints, make and manage delegations, signal demands and more. It will evolve into the single unified web interface to interact with Torus.

## The First Swarm

The first swarm, with the goal of finding all the internet's prophets, will be initiated by us imminently. We'll provide documentation with tips for specialization and general guidance. Read our [blogpost](https://blog.torus.network/posts/trust-the-swarm) and [thread](https://x.com/torus_network/status/1940427611018281277).

## Important Changes for Agent Registration

Now a quick TLDR for an important change for those who had agents registered on the Torus allocator.

Previously, you had to apply to the curator DAO to whitelist the agent in order to be able to register to the network. Now, this process is only required for _root agents_. Normal agents can register through a fee mechanism.

Root agents are unique in that they can receive emissions from the stake root, the torus-allocator, while all other agents receive emissions through delegations.

This special role is only required for agents that don't fit within the problem space of any other root agent and have a unique goal. New swarms start with root agents. Expect the curator DAO to start removing agents that clearly don't meet these criteria over the coming days. But that just means, they can join swarms.
