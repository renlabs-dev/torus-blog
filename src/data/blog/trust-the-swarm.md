# Torus Prediction Swarm: Predicting the Predictors

With yesterday's big news of Polymarket integrating with X, it's a good moment to shine a light on the Torus prediction swarm and explain the opportunity it represents.

## Intro

In Torus, swarms self-assemble around goals. These goals are what agents develop specialized capabilities for. So what is the initial goal of the prediction swarm?

**The goal is to predict who can predict the future.**
In other words, to know when to pay attention to whom.

### How Can You Predict Who Is a Good Predictor?

You can look at everything someone has predicted in the past and verify whether it turned out to be true or false. Very straightforward, very powerful.

This method applies to both:

* **Explicit predictions**: e.g. “Trump admin will release the Epstein Client list within 48 hours”
* **Implicit predictions**: e.g. “I'm feeling super optimistic about Bitcoin right now”

For example:
If someone has made 17 predictions on U.S. politics and 15 were provably correct, their opinion should carry more weight than someone who made 6 predictions with 4 of them wrong.

## Why Is This Valuable?

This applies to all fields where humans make predictions—including crypto and stock markets. Imagine knowing the exact success rate of an account’s calls across market niches. Someone might be spot-on with Solana shitcoin calls but consistently wrong on Ethereum utility plays.

All that data is out there—ready to be extracted, verified, and integrated. It's also incredibly useful for platforms like Polymarket.

In business and field-specific cases, especially during times of volatility, **knowing whose predictions to trust is a massive advantage**.

### Imagine This Flow:

1. You wonder about topic X.
2. You ask the swarm.
3. The swarm finds all predictions made on topic X.
4. It checks each predictor’s historical accuracy.
5. It calculates a trust metric for each predictor on topic X.
6. You now know which predictions are signal and which are noise.

A lot of value in the world comes down to **knowing when to listen to whom on what**.

## The Insane Opportunity of Social Prediction Data

Social media holds vast, mature prediction data that can be:

* Aggregated
* Processed
* Scored for reliability on any given topic

This gives us **hard data** on who to trust in real time.

## How Is Torus Useful Here?

The idea is simple. Executing at scale is hard.

Prediction verification is nuanced. It requires many specialized agents working together—perfect for a **decentralized swarm** to self-organize around and continuously optimize.

Torus enables agents to specialize at any level, while staying aligned with the whole. It forms a decentralized structure where **the whole becomes more capable than the sum of its parts**.

There's **open competition** at every function level. Improving any one function benefits the whole swarm—a **positive-sum game**.

## Why Choose Prediction as the Goal?

1. **Huge opportunity**: A powerful startup could be built solely around this. But a Torus-based swarm can outperform any centralized startup at scale.
2. **Utility for future swarms**: Torus operates as one super-swarm. Everything the prediction swarm develops can be reused as modular infrastructure for future swarms.

At its core, prediction is about **information gathering and processing**. Capabilities from this goal are general and widely applicable.

## The Core Component: Swarm Memory

The swarm's **memory** is a structured shared database:

* Stores all predictions, profiles, metrics
* Enables agents to cooperate over shared context

The **swarm API** is the second critical piece:

* General-purpose
* Reusable
* Powers agent coordination

Together, memory + API are the **off-chain core infrastructure** for decentralized swarm formation and optimization.

## A Deeper Meaning

Prediction is a core social function.
Yet no system today holds people accountable for failed predictions or highlights truly reliable voices beyond superficial "expert" labels.

* **No accountability**: People throw out predictions without consequences.
* **Wasted talent**: Skilled but unknown predictors get ignored due to low visibility.

Fixing this with **reputation backed by verified prediction history** could realign incentives across social platforms.

## What’s Next?

As soon as **Torus v0.5** hits mainnet (soon™), the **memory and API for the prediction swarm** will be released.

The first agents will integrate:

* Early abilities: find, verify predictions, assess trustworthiness.
* Initially rough, but fast improvement as agents specialize and niches are mapped.

Once effective, tools will be built on top of the swarm to allow it to interact on X (Twitter) with full predictive knowledge.

There’s also a **surprise** coming to boost the swarm further—stay tuned.
