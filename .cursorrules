# Torus Blog - Cursor Rules

## Language and Documentation

- **All code, comments, and documentation must be written in English**
- Variable names, function names, and file names should use English terminology
- Code comments should be clear, concise, and in English
- Commit messages should be in English

## Code Style and Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint configuration defined in `eslint.config.js`
- Use Prettier for code formatting (config in `.prettierrc.mjs`)
- No `console.log` statements in production code (use proper logging)
- Prefer `const` over `let` when variables won't be reassigned
- Use explicit types instead of `any` - prefer union types or proper interfaces
- Use `@ts-expect-error` instead of `@ts-ignore` with explanatory comments

### File Organization

- Component files should be in PascalCase (e.g., `Header.astro`)
- Utility files should be in camelCase (e.g., `getAllPosts.ts`)
- Keep components modular and focused on single responsibility
- Group related utilities in appropriate directories

### Astro Specific

- Use Astro's content collections for blog posts (`src/data/blog/`)
- Support both Markdown posts and Sanity CMS posts
- Use `getCollection()` for markdown, `getSanityPosts()` for CMS content
- Always use `getAllPosts()` utility when fetching all blog posts
- Properly handle both content types in layouts and pages

### Sanity CMS

- Schema definitions in `schemaTypes/` directory
- Use `@sanity/astro` integration for Studio at `/admin` route
- Convert Portable Text to HTML using `@portabletext/to-html`
- Sanity posts are identified by absence of `filePath` property

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow existing design patterns for consistency
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Use CSS variables for theme colors (defined in config)

## Git Workflow

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages in English
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use conventional commit format when possible
- Test locally before committing
- Run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run format` before commits

## Testing and Quality

- Run `pnpm run lint` to check for linting issues
- Run `pnpm run format:check` to verify formatting
- Run `pnpm run format` to auto-fix formatting issues
- Test both markdown and Sanity posts functionality
- Verify responsive design on multiple screen sizes

## Documentation

- Update documentation when adding new features
- Keep README.md and docs/CMS.md in sync with changes
- Document complex logic with inline comments
- Include JSDoc comments for exported functions

## Content Management

- Blog posts can come from two sources:
  1. Markdown files in `src/data/blog/`
  2. Sanity CMS via `/admin` interface
- Both sources should be treated equally in listings and routing
- Maintain consistent schema between markdown frontmatter and Sanity schema

## Performance

- Optimize images and assets
- Use Astro's static site generation capabilities
- Minimize client-side JavaScript
- Leverage content collections for efficient data fetching

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA labels where needed
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Maintain sufficient color contrast

## Environment Variables

- Store sensitive data in `.env` (git ignored)
- Document required env vars in `.env.example`
- Use `PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side accessible variables
- Never commit actual API keys or tokens
